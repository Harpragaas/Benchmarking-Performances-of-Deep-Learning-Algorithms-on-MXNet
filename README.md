# Benchmarking-Performances-of-Deep-Learning-Algorithms-on-MXNet

This was part of my honours project at the Australian National University.The study focuses on image classification, one of the most popular deep learning applications and conducts performance analysis for MXNet, comparing it with that of the Pytorch Model.
